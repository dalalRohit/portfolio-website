In many modern websites you must have seen this effect of Navigation bar/ Header sticking to the top of the page even if you scroll down the page for your better navigation so you don't have to go up always to choose between links for moving between links. Haven't you?

If you have and are curious about how does that work, then this post is your go to guide to create that very simple yet beautiful effect/feature for you next project which adds better UX to the page.

We are going to be using <code>react</code> in this tutorial with some little state management. Although, if you are pretty well in Web Technologies, you can convert this logic in any of the framework you like. Totally flexible!

If you are not that comfy with react, don't worry about it. You can just follow along. I have tried to use minimal of technical jargons. Logic is pretty explanatory

What are you  waiting for? Let's get started ðŸš€

 <br/>

<hr/>



## Initial Setup

<aside>
    I'm assuming here you have Node.js installed and create-react-app installed.
</aside>



First we are going to create a react-app from start. For that enter this command in your favorite terminal

```npm
create-react-app sticky-navbar
```

We are going to delete some of the files created out of the box from create-react-app. After deleting some files, project directory will look like this:

![File structure](./file-structure.png)

*Starting file structure*

We will start by creating components, two components will suffice for this little project. Create a directory called **Components** in <code>/src</code> and add two files <code>Navbar.js</code> and <code>Content.js</code> <br/> <br/>

Start by editing <code>App.js</code>. Add following code to start with a basic layout

```jsx
//App.js
import React from 'react';

import Navbar from './components/Navbar';
import Content from './components/Content';


function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Navbar />
      <Content />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

Here we are rendering two functional components ***Navbar*** and ***Content***, their name clearly explains their purpose.

This below code fills up <code>Navbar.js</code>. Navbar component is basically a header section which consists of your website Logo and one navigation menu with 4/5 links

```jsx
//Navbar.js
import React from 'react';
import './navbar.scss';
import Logo from './../img/logo.svg';

const Navbar=() => {
  return (
    <header className={navbarClasses.join(" ")}>
        <div className="logo">
          <img src={Logo} alt="Logo" title="Logo" />
        </div>

        <nav className="navigation">
            <ul>
              <li>Home</li>
              <li>Home</li>
              <li>Home</li>
              <li>Home</li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        
    </header>
  )
};

export default Navbar;

```

Now, it's time to give some styling to the page. You can have your own set of styling or if you just wanna you use mine, copy below given styles to <code>navbar.scss</code>

I'm using SASS here for styling. If you are not comfortable with SASS, you can use normal CSS3 syntax. Works same!

```scss
//navbar.scss

.navbar{
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 100%;
  min-height: 6vh;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #eee;
  transition: all .7s ease-in;
}

.scrolled{
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: lightblue;
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 10% 0 10%;
}
.logo img{
  width: 50px;
}

.navigation{
  ul{
    box-sizing: border-box;
    list-style-type: none;
    display: flex;
    min-height: 6vh;
    justify-content: flex-end;
    align-items: center;

    li{
      text-align: center;
      padding: .5em;
      cursor: pointer;
      &:hover{
        background-color: plum;
        color: white;
      }
    }

    li a{
      text-decoration: none;
      color: inherit;
    }

  }
}

```



Now, we would fill up <code>Content.js</code> with some meat to add some content on the page along with the Navbar.

This code fills up dummy boxes to take ample amount of height on page. You can use any real life content. This is just for demo

```jsx
//Content.js

import React from 'react';
import './content.scss';

const Content=() => {
  const data=`<replace-your-long-dummy-text/any content-here>`;

  return (
    <main className="content">
      <p id="post1" >{data}</p>
      <p id="post2" >{data}</p>
      <p id="post3" >{data}</p>
      <p id="post4" >{data}</p>
    </main>
  )
}

export default Content;

```

Style for Content.js

```scss
//content.scss

.content{
    width: 80%;
    margin:2rem 10% 0 10%;
    max-width: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
.box{
    width:80%;
    margin:2rem 10% 0 10%;
    height:100vh;
    background-color:plum;
}
```

After all this setup, our page will look like this:

![Complete layout](./complete-layout.PNG)

*This is the visual after this much code*

### Main Logic 

Now that we have our meat setup for the Sticky navbar, we will add the main Logic to get the upper navbar stick to the top as you scroll down. For this we are going to do little bit of state-management using [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). If you are not aware of react-hooks, don't worry about it. You can use normal state management with classful component too. The logic remains the same. 

So, the idea is as you scroll down, you check if the scrollTop (i.e. total height you have scrolled from the  top in pixels ) in <code>componentDidMount()</code> or <code>useEffect()</code> and based on some <b>fixed</b> value of that offset, you change the class of navbar to apply styles which hooks it up to the top. Here in my case, as you can see on line 10 of the below code, I'm checking if offset > 200. If that value is greater than 200, I'm setting <code>scrolled </code> to true. This 200px is some fixed offset, which changes according to your application. Now, whenever the user scrolls more than 200px from top, I'm adding "scrolled" to  navbarClasses.

Confused ?

```jsx
import React,{useEffect} from 'react';
import './navbar.scss';
import Logo from './../img/logo.svg';

const Navbar=() => {
  const [scrolled,setScrolled]=React.useState(false);

  const handleScroll=() => {
    const offset=window.scrollY;
    if(offset > 200 ){
      setScrolled(true);
    }
    else{
      setScrolled(false);
    }
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('scroll',handleScroll)
  })

  let navbarClasses=['navbar'];
  if(scrolled){
    navbarClasses.push('scrolled');
  }
  
   /*rest remains the same*/
};

export default Navbar;

```







## Conclusion

This was all for this simple demo application. I hope this post was helpful to you and I've solved your problem by explaining it in your words. If you have any queries regarding this post, feel free to ask me personally. I will be happy to answer those on individual level.

Thank you. Have a nice day!
